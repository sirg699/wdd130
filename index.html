        <p>Hello my name is Kennedy Iseh, I live in Port-Harcourt, Nigeria. I was born and raised here and i've only
            lived outside Port-Harcourt for 2 years of my life when i served a mission, i lived in Benin city and
            briefly in Delta state, it was a really interesting experience cause i got to meet and interact with a lot
            of new people and learn about different cultures too.</p>
